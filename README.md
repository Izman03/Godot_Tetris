Tetris Clone in Godot


This project is a Tetris clone developed using the Godot Engine. It aims to replicate the classic Tetris gameplay experience, introducing blocks of different shapes falling from the top of the screen, which players need to position to complete lines and score points.

Features

Classic Tetris gameplay mechanics: Rotate, move, and drop Tetriminos to complete lines.
Score tracking: Points increase by completing lines with more points awarded for clearing multiple lines at once.
Level progression: The game speeds up as the player scores more points, increasing the challenge.
Next Tetrimino preview: Players can see the next Tetrimino to plan their moves ahead of time.

How to Play

Left/Right Arrow Keys: Move the Tetrimino sideways.
Up Arrow Key: Rotate the Tetrimino clockwise.
Down Arrow Key: Soft drop (speeds up the Tetrimino's fall).
